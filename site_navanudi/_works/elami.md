# Branding for a publishing house

Tallinn Architecture Biennale TAB 2019 is titled “Beauty Matters: The Resurgence of Beauty” and is curated by Dr Yael Reisner.
TAB Opening Week will take place on the 11th– 15th September.

Many architects still associate the word beauty with shallowness, old world, or non-progressive values, cultural bias that is expressed in architecture and also in politics, psychology, poetry and music. Paradoxically, the first measure of good architecture continues to be its capacity to create a great aesthetic experience. 

The pursuit of beauty ceased to be a lead generator of architectural design in the early 1940s, when objective considerations were promoted as rational and pragmatic and subjective decision making seen as irrelevant.
